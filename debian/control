Description: cron-like daemon which handles filesystem events
 incron-next is an "inotify cron new generation" system. It works like the regular cron but is
 driven by filesystem events instead of time events. This package provides two
 programs, a daemon called "incrond" (analogous to crond) and a table
 manipulator "incrontab" (like "crontab").
 .
 incron-next uses the Linux Kernel inotify syscalls.
 .
 like cron, each user can edit its own incron-next tables.
 .
 incron-next can be used to :
  - notifying programs (e.g. server daemons) about changes in configuration
  - guarding changes in critical files (with their eventual recovery)
  - file usage monitoring, statistics
  - automatic on-crash cleanup
  - automatic on-change backup or versioning
  - new mail notification (for maildir)
  - server upload notification
  - installation management (outside packaging systems)
  - ... and many others
